These files are from the second edition of "UNIX Power Tools."
If you have the book's first edition, you'll find that some of these
files are different: there were updates, additions, and deletions.
 
These are individual files; all of them are also available as an
archive file named upt9707.tgz, in the parent directory.
 
The Web page http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/upt2/examples/ has a
clickable interface that includes descriptions of these files.
